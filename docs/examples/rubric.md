# Example Rubric

ACME Corp is the developer of an innovative L1 blockchain written in FORTRAN. To bootstrap its ecosystem, ACME funds teams who build applications with $100k grants. 

ACME retroactively grades grants on two criteria: project completion and project adoption. Each of these is half the weight of a grant’s score.

## Completion
Projects can receive a 0 to 0.5 completion score. Here’s how the number is determined:

- 0: this project essentially ran off with the money, releasing nothing publicly.
- 0.25: this project did not launch but it did develop part of the product; there’s a codebase that another project would be able to use.
- 0.5: this project fully launched.

## Adoption
Projects can receive a 0 to 0.5 adoption score. Here’s how the number is determined:

- 0: if it’s a consumer product, 50 people or less have used this product; if it’s a DeFi product, it’s acquired less than $50k in TVL.
- 0.5: if it’s a consumer product, 500 people or less have used this product; if it’s a DeFi product, it’s acquired less than $500k in TVL.
- 1: if it’s a consumer product, 2,500 people or more have used it; if it’s a DeFi product, it’s acquired more than $2.5M in TVL.

## Methodology
Grants are scored by a grants committee of 5 people, 3 from ACME and 2 from MetaDAO. The total score is computed by averaging the scores of the 5 committee members.

## Timeline
Grants are scored 3 months after the grant has been given.
