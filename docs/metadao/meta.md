# META

MetaDAO is governed by META, whose mint is METADDFL6wWMWEoKTFJwcThTbUmtarRJZjRpzUvkxhr.

On November 15th 2023, 10,000 META was [airdropped to 60 wallets](https://blog.metadao.fi/the-meta-dao-decentralizes-d2d01dd5aa45), with the remaining 990,000 META being sent to MetaDAO's treasury. All other META has entered the circulating supply through market-approved governance proposals.

In March 2024, a group of community members created a proposal to [burn 979,000 META from the treasury](https://futarchy.metadao.fi/metadao/proposals/ELwCkHt1U9VBpUFJ7qGoVMatEwLSr1HYj9q9t8JQ1NcU). That proposal passed, meaning that MetaDAO may need to eventually migrate to a new token mint if it wants to issue new tokens.
